I am a security engineer at the [Ethereum Foundation][7] in the Solidity team. In my spare time, I am a freelance security researcher.

I obtained my Ph.D. in computer science at the chair for [Security in Telecommunications][1] (SecT), TU Berlin in 2018. My dissertation is titled __Compiler Assisted Vulnerability Assessment__. I obtained an M.Sc. in computer science from [EPFL][2] and a B.Tech in electrical engineering from [NITK][3].

I have developed software for [Ittiam Systems][4], and conducted research on mobile systems security at the [Fraunhofer SIT][5], and [Rice University computer security lab][6].
